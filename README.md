# Boosting Classifier

This classifier was part of a [project](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/jaa/CS6140.11F/Homeworks/hw.04.html) for my Fall 2011 [machine learning class](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/jaa/CS6140.11F/).

To run, put *spambase.data* from the UCI [spambase dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Spambase) into the same directory as *homework4.py*.

    $ python2 homework4.py --beststump

This will create decision stump for each feature & datapoint in folds 2..10 and boost with the optimal one until a convergence criterion is met. Data for a ROC curve is written on exit.

#### Options:

    homework4.py
        --folds    NUM    #  How many folds to make from the dataset (default: 10).
        --testfold NUM    #  Which fold to use for testing           (default: 0).
        --rounds   NUM    #  How many rounds to run                  (default: until convergence).
        --beststump       #  Choose the optimal decision stump       (default: random choice).

See [my analysis](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PBH77j165_xkoVMOm9Dscf_z7RMGv4OM5PpaXmeXiNY/edit) for a discussion of the results.
